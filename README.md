*Cashire*

My friend and I, both former classmates, are embarking on an exciting journey into the realm of finance and quantitative trading. Our endeavor blends conventional techniques with cutting-edge AI technology to construct am automated trading system. We employ traditional methods for primary signal generation, while harnessing the power of AI models for precise risk assessment and optimal capital allocation.

*LLM crime stories adventures*

Teaming up with another close friend, we've delved into the captivating world of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our shared passion for unraveling the mysteries of these immensely popular AI systems fuels our mission to create an innovative and immersive crime story game. In this engaging experience, players step into the shoes of detectives, using the LLM's capabilities to craft intricate narratives and guide them through a series of murder mysteries. By harnessing the potential of these technologies, we aim to provide players with an enthralling and dynamic gaming experience like never before.
